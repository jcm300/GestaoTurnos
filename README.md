# GestaoTurnos
GestaoTurnos is a project implemented in the context of the Software System Development Course at **Universidade do Minho** which aims to develop a shift management utility.
This utility should allow for the addition of new courses and students as well as managing the allocation of students in their respective shifts in each course.
It should also allow students to change between shifts via an exchange mechanism.
